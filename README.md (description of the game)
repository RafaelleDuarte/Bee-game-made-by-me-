# Bee-game-made-by-me-

My game is moulded to be a bee trying to escape from a ball that has a sort of AI behaviour and keeps crossing the screen
automatically from top to the bottom and from left to the right. 
The bee can move throughout the screen and becomes red when the collision with the ball occurs. Besides, my code applies 
gravity to the bee, making it bounce and jump smoothly. The game needs adjustments though.
